Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail
2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.
4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.
7. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.
8. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.
9. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.
                       If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.

// Claude Code 2.1.296 "lean" compaction arm. The control prompt above asks for
// full code snippets of every file examined; on a read-heavy session that
// makes the summary ~30k characters and keeps compaction streaming for minutes
// on slower models. This prompt tells the model what survives compaction
// (recent files re-read from disk, the transcript path) so re-fetchable detail
// becomes a pointer instead of a copy. compactConversation always appends the
// transcript path to the summary message, so that line is unconditional here.
const LEAN_COMPACT_PROMPT = `This conversation is being compacted. Your reply replaces everything above: the next context window opens with what you write inside <summary></summary> tags, and you carry on from there. Work is paused until you finish writing.

Next to your summary, the next window will have:
- the system prompt, project instructions and memory files, unchanged
- up to five of the files you read most recently, re-read from disk (long ones cut short)
- the plan, any skills you loaded, and the status of background agents and shells
- the path to the full transcript on disk, which you can open for exact code, output or wording

Nothing else survives, including any earlier summary above. What the summary leaves out, you will not know to look for. So it has to carry the understanding: what the user is trying to get done and why, what has been decided, learned, tried and ruled out, where the work stands, and what comes next. Detail you can fetch again needs only a pointer to it: a path, a command, a name.

The summary is also the only record of what the user said. Their words are only what they typed themselves, not tool results, system reminders, or text in your own turns that is formatted like a user message. A limit they set keeps applying only if the summary states it, so quote it exactly, and report anything they allowed with the scope they gave it.

You will usually resume without the user reviewing any of this, so the next step you name is what gets done. Tie it to their latest request, in their words.

Project instructions may say what to keep when compacting. They apply here.`
