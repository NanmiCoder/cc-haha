  Operate desktop applications on macOS, Windows and Linux through native accessibility trees,
  using the agent-desktop CLI. Use when an AI agent must see or act on a desktop GUI:
  click buttons, fill forms, read UI state, navigate menus, toggle checkboxes, scroll,
  drag, type text, press shortcuts, take screenshots, manage windows, use the clipboard,
  launch or close apps, read notifications.
  Triggers on: "click button", "fill form", "open app", "read UI", "computer use",
  "operate desktop", "accessibility tree", "snapshot app", "type into field", "navigate menu",
  "toggle checkbox", "take screenshot", "desktop automation", "agent-desktop",
  or any desktop GUI task on macOS, Windows or Linux.

# agent-desktop

agent-desktop is a CLI that lets an AI agent observe and operate desktop apps through the OS accessibility tree. It is a tool, not an agent. Every command prints one JSON envelope (`ok`, `data` or `error`). The observe, act and verify loop runs in you.

## Shell syntax

Examples use a POSIX shell. In PowerShell, quote every ref (`'@s8f3k2p9:e1'`), because a bare `@token` is the splatting operator. Use `$env:NAME = 'value'` instead of `export`, and `| ConvertFrom-Json` instead of `$(...)` and `jq`. The Windows skill has the PowerShell forms.

## First run

1. Run `agent-desktop status`. It reports the platform, permissions and `supported_surfaces`.
2. Run `agent-desktop skills get platform`. It loads the skill for the OS the binary runs on (macOS, Windows or Linux).
3. For flags and syntax, run `agent-desktop <command> --help`. This skill does not repeat flag lists.

## The loop

Use `find` when you know the role or exact name. Otherwise map the app first and drill into one region.

```
agent-desktop snapshot --skeleton --app "Notes" -i --compact   # shallow map, children_count on cut branches
agent-desktop snapshot --root @s8f3k2p9:e3 -i --compact        # drill into one region
agent-desktop click @s8f3k2p9:e12                              # act on a qualified ref
agent-desktop snapshot --root @s8f3k2p9:e3 -i --compact        # verify: re-read the same region
```

- A small app needs no skeleton. Take a full `snapshot -i`.
- Never skeleton a surface (`--surface menu`, `sheet`, `alert`). A surface is already focused.
- An action that opens a menu, sheet or alert lists it in `data.surfaces`. Target that overlay next.
- After an async step, use `wait` (see `commands-system.md`). A fixed sleep is a race.

## Refs

- Output refs are qualified: `@<snapshot_id>:e<N>`, for example `@s8f3k2p9:e1`. Pass them to later commands as they are.
- Refs are valid for one snapshot. After any UI change, re-drill the affected region or take a new snapshot.
- Only addressable elements get refs. Static text and inert containers do not.
- `STALE_REF`: the ref no longer matches the live UI. Take a fresh snapshot and use the new ref.
- `AMBIGUOUS_TARGET`: more than one live element matches. Narrow the target with `find --role --name --exact` or `--root`, then use the new ref.
- `SNAPSHOT_NOT_FOUND`: the snapshot id expired. Snapshot again.

## Delivery and retry

Action results carry `data.disposition` and errors carry `error.disposition`, each with `delivery` and `retry`. Observation commands such as `snapshot` have none on success; their errors, and every `INVALID_ARGS` refusal, carry `not_delivered` and `retry: safe`.

- Retry or substitute an action only when `disposition.retry` is `safe`. Only `not_delivered` is safe.
- Any other delivery value means the action may have landed. A repeat can click, type or submit twice, and `toggle` can undo itself.
- On a result that is not safe, read the live state (`get`, `is`, or a fresh snapshot) and decide from that. `details.post_state` helps when present.
- Branch on `error.code` and `error.disposition`. Message and suggestion text can change.
- `details.retryable: false` means waiting cannot change the outcome. Try a different approach.

## Headless and headed

Ref actions are headless by default. They use semantic accessibility calls and do not take focus, move the cursor, synthesize keys or use the clipboard. If no semantic path exists, the action fails closed. Use the global `--headed` flag only when the user explicitly permits physical input, such as double-click, hover, drag, or focus. Never switch to headed mode to recover from a headless failure. Raw coordinates (`--xy`) never imply focus. Which actions need `--headed` differs by OS: read the platform skill.

## References

Load one only when you need it: `agent-desktop skills get desktop <reference>`.

| Reference | Open it when |
|-----------|--------------|
| `commands-observation` | You need `snapshot`, `find`, `get`, `is`, `screenshot`, `list-surfaces` semantics, partial trees, or the `--root` rules |
| `commands-interaction` | You choose between click, type, set-value, select, toggle, scroll, press and mouse commands, or you debug an action error |
| `commands-system` | You launch or close apps, manage windows, use the clipboard, `wait`, `batch`, sessions, multi-agent cursors, tracing, or load skills |
| `workflows` | You want worked patterns (forms, menus, dialogs, waiting for a new window, scroll-find, drag) and the anti-patterns list |
